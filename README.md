# AlgorithmProject
8 different implementations of heaps and priority queues of which, 2 of them fully work.
My project also includes, the project for last term's algorithm design course (1401 project).
The other 6 implementations which partially work, I have included in the project as "failed attempts" to show the path it took for me to finally get working :)
The main fully working implementations are named "max_min_heap.py" and "2ndProjectAlgorithm.py"
